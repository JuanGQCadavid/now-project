Pendings:
* Check s3 confifguration
* Add cloudfront
* Add Lambda logic
* S3 events
* S3 life cycle



To work:
- [x] Generate presogned URL with public / private - and metadata associated
- [ ] Validate the user rigts to update an event, a date (chat) or they own profile against Neo4j
- [ ] Define a S3 path for each element
- [ ] Helm!
- [ ] fdfsf

So far:
- ChatId is DateId until friends and chat module are implemented
    - - A user has access to send on the chat only if it is attending an event
