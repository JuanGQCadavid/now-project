# The General view feature model folder

* model -> This will contain the core/hexagon/bussiness logic of the features, this one will do all the logic and will be connected to the services, in order to only have one of this class instanciated we are going to use a proivider in the view model in oder to have a single instance used across the feature ( this could also have streams, so we are going to use differente kinds of providers!)
