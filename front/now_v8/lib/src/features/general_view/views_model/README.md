# The General view feature view_model folder

* Views_model -> here we are going to have only the state manager that will connect the view with the model.


## How to manage the state ?

The idea is to have a combination of StateNotifierProvider with StateNotifier, where we are going to simplify our lifes just managin one state per notifier, thus we are going to be more granular and avoiding creating big view-models monsters!
